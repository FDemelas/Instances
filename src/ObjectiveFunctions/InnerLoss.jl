"""
Innner Loss function for the training of a neural network for image classification of the MNIST dataset.
It works with batches and so `x` and `y` are, respectively, the input and the output of the batch.
An input `x` is an 28×28 image, here encoded as a vector and y is the number (between 0 and 9) represented in the image, here encoded as one-hot-vector.
The loss function considered in the 'inner' learning task is here denoted by `loss`, that is rescaled dividing it by `rescaling_factor`.
The neural network has `length(layers)` hidden layers. The `i`-th layer has size `layers[i]`. 
Note: This function is not really concave, but it could be used to test our package for Meta-Learning.

Forward-pass for the `InnerLoss`.
It computes the output of the network and compute the loss function between the prediction and the labels.
As said in the definition of `InnerLoss` inputs and labels corresponds to a batch.
Note: this function takes as input the parameters of the 'hidden' network and compute the associated prediction and then provides the loss value of the former.
